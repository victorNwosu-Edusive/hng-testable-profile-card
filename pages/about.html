      <p>Hey, I’m Victor Nwosu, I'm a frontend developer who loves bringing ideas to life. 
        My journey into tech started with simple curiosity and raw passion in Tech.

I enjoy building clean, responsive websites and webapps, 
especially the kind that make people stop and say, “wow, this looks nice.” Each of my projects teach 
me something new about creativity and problem-solving.</p>

            <p>During this program, my goal is to level up my frontend development skills, 
                get more comfortable working with deadlines, 
                and learn from others who share the same passion for tech. 
                I also want to use this experience to build a stronger portfolio and connect with people in the industry.</p>

      <p>Dear Future me, be proud of how far you’ve come, even if it doesn’t always feel like much. 
        Take breaks when you need to, rest is still part of progress. You’re allowed to outgrow things 
        and people that no longer align with where you’re headed, and that’s perfectly okay. Don’t lose the 
        excitement that got you started in the first place. Stay kind, stay curious, and stay grounded, no matter 
        how far you go.</p>

      <p>I feel like some days will feel slower than others, and that’s fine, 
        progress isn’t always loud. But I've learnt to keep showing up, even in small ways. 
        The version of me from a year ago would be proud of how much I’ve learned and how 
        much stronger my mindset has become. I'm keeping my circle filled with people who challenge and uplift me. 
        And most importantly, I'm celebrating the little wins; they’re proof that I’m moving forward.</p>
